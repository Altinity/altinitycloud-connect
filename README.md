# altinitycloud-connect

`altinitycloud-connect` is a tunneling daemon for Altinity.Cloud; part of 
Altinity.Cloud Anywhere.  
It enables management of ClickHouse clusters (running inside your Kubernetes clusters,
wherever they may be) through Altinity.Cloud. 

At present, this repository is used only to distribute pre-built `altinitycloud-connect` binaries.  
The source code is scheduled to be released once we're out of Beta.
